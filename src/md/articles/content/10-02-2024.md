We are pleased to share our change & decision log with you, starting with how it all began, and we will begin right now.

## <a name="idea"></a> Idea

To build a bigger product, we saw the need to learn SEO at a smaller level. The idea struck us when a colleague visited an online comparison site and noticed its subpar quality. We decided to focus on practicing SEO for that tool while simultaneously working on a better version of the service.

We will create an application that addresses issues related to text files, including validation, formatting, conversion, and comparison. We will work with all text file formats such as plain text, JSON, XML, YAML (YML), and others.

## <a name="traffic"></a> Traffic

Our week started with a discussion on how to generate traffic and determining the most effective types of traffic. There are several types of traffic:

-   Direct
-   Organic
-   Paid
-   Referred
-   Social
-   Email Marketing

**Direct traffic** occurs when a user types the exact URL of a website into their browser's address bar.

**Organic traffic** is a direct result of a search engine optimization strategy. Visitors who arrive at a website by clicking on a non-ad search result are considered examples of organic traffic.

**Paid traffic** is the opposite of organic traffic. This type of traffic occurs when a product pays for advertising, causing the service to appear at the top of search results and be marked with a 'Sponsored' label.

**Referral traffic** is generated through link building or backlinking strategies. This involves other websites including a link to your site, either voluntarily or through actions such as user comments or other user-generated content. It's important to note that employing Black Hat methods, such as purchasing services that spam links across the internet, can lead to a negative reputation for your website. This negative reputation may result in a decrease in your search index ranking.

**Social traffic** is when people visit a website through social media, like Twitter or Facebook. It can be from regular posts or paid ads on platforms such as Snapchat and YouTube. If someone comes to a site directly from a social media platform, it's considered social traffic, whether it's from a regular post or a paid promotion.

**Email marketing** can bring a lot of web traffic if people have given you permission to email them. While not everyone may check every email, it's a powerful way to reach your audience directly. It's like a digital flyer, reminding people to check out what you have to offer, and sometimes, getting in their inbox is the first step to getting them through your door.

Certainly, for each product, the focus on the type of traffic is selected individually. In our case, the emphasis is on **organic search traffic**.

## <a name="final-product-vision"></a> Final product vision

Once we finalized the idea, we started discussing how the application would look in its final version. We envisioned a service that, as mentioned earlier, would focus on formatting, converting, and comparing text files of all formats, such as plain text, JSON, XML, YAML (YML).

## <a name="mvp"></a>MVP (Minimum viable product)

After discussing the idea and the overall vision for the product, we started creating the Minimum Viable Product (MVP). In our case, since we decided to build a comparator, the MVP consists of two text fields that compare two JSONs with button between fields.

## <a name="backlog"></a>Backlog

Compiling the backlog was a particularly interesting part, as it required a shift in thinking from a development perspective to a product-oriented approach. Typically, when developers create their product, it's often just a set of features they like and find useful for users. Therefore, the backlog is crucial in helping to establish the immediate goals for the product and determine the order and priorities.

While compiling the backlog, the first thing we noticed was that the application should be online before we implement the core functionality. Therefore, we decided to first launch the website, establish basic backlinking, and only then proceed to develop the functionality.

## <a name="seo"></a>Basic SEO & Back links

While studying SEO, we found the service <a href="https://ahrefs.com/" target="\_blank">**ahrefs**</a> to be very helpful, along with <a href="https://ahrefs.com/seo" target="\_blank">**"The Beginner’s Guide to SEO"**</a>. These articles guided us on how to search for keywords, phrases, and how to create meta tags for the page, which we implemented in our SEO strategy.

<img src="/ahrefs-website-screenshot-mobile.webp"
    fetchpriority="low"
    srcset="/ahrefs-website-screenshot-mobile.webp 767w,
    /ahrefs-website-screenshot.webp 768w"
    style="min-height: 416px" 
  alt="ahrefs-website-screenshot">

It's evident that to create backlinks, we needed to establish a place to which links could be directed. Therefore, among the top-priority tasks, in addition to studying SEO, were:

-   Purchasing a domain
-   Creating a GitHub repository to formalize the first backlink
-   Deploying the application
-   Setting up a placeholder website with basic metadata
    -   Meta title
    -   Meta description
    -   H1, H2 headings

## <a name="first-back-link"></a>First Back link

After creating the placeholder website, we can now proceed to create the first external links to our service. We learned that it's possible to pay certain services to place links to your site, but it's worth noting that bots can easily detect purchased backlinks. Moreover, buying traffic is not our goal; we aim to generate organic traffic from users who find our services genuinely helpful.

The simplest way to implement backlinking for your site is to visit platforms where people share links to their startups and leave your links there. However, given that the theme of our product is developer-oriented, we can leverage Q&A sites such as Quora and Stack Overflow for this purpose.

To keep track of where and when to place links, we created a database in Notion where we compiled a list of resources and assigned the first date when we plan to post a link to our site. Since we consider ourselves responsible internet users, we do not recommend simply leaving links as responses to questions. This not only pollutes sites that are friendly to us but may also lead to being banned, which is entirely justified.

The first site where we placed a backlink to our application was Quora. There, we found a question asking how to compare two JSONs. We provided the user with a comprehensive response, detailing how it can be done in pure JavaScript, using libraries, or showcasing our service as a no-code solution.

We were pleased with our first placed backlink until we remembered the existence of the "rel=nofollow" attribute

We found that websites use the "rel=nofollow" attribute for links, which prevents search engines from following these links. Therefore, backlinking is only effective on websites that allow "dofollow" links.

Afterward, we went through all the listed websites and realized that 90% of them simply block bots from accessing our application. And that's how our first week of creating Difff.app went.
