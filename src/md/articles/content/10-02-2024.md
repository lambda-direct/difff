## <a name="idea"></a> Idea

To build a bigger product, we saw the need to learn SEO at a smaller level. The idea struck us when a colleague visited an online comparison site and noticed its subpar quality. We decided to focus on practicing SEO for that tool while simultaneously working on a better version of the service. We will create an application that addresses issues related to text files, including validation, formatting, conversion, and comparison. We will work with all text file formats such as plain text, JSON, XML, YAML (YML), and others.

## <a name="traffic"></a> Traffic

Our week started with a discussion on how to generate traffic and determining the most effective types of traffic. There are several types of traffic:

-   Direct
-   Organic
-   Paid
-   Referred
-   Social
-   Email Marketing

**Direct traffic** occurs when a user types the exact URL of a website into their browser's address bar.

**Organic traffic** is a direct result of a search engine optimization strategy. Visitors who arrive at a website by clicking on a non-ad search result are considered examples of organic traffic.

**Paid traffic** is the opposite of organic traffic. This type of traffic occurs when a product pays for advertising, causing the service to appear at the top of search results and be marked with a 'Sponsored' label.

**Referral traffic** is generated through link building or backlinking strategies. This involves other websites including a link to your site, either voluntarily or through actions such as user comments or other user-generated content. It's important to note that employing Black Hat methods, such as purchasing services that spam links across the internet, can lead to a negative reputation for your website. This negative reputation may result in a decrease in your search index ranking.

**Social traffic** is when people visit a website through social media, like Twitter or Facebook. It can be from regular posts or paid ads on platforms such as Snapchat and YouTube. If someone comes to a site directly from a social media platform, it's considered social traffic, whether it's from a regular post or a paid promotion.

**Email marketing** can bring a lot of web traffic if people have given you permission to email them. While not everyone may check every email, it's a powerful way to reach your audience directly. It's like a digital flyer, reminding people to check out what you have to offer, and sometimes, getting in their inbox is the first step to getting them through your door.

Certainly, for each product, the focus on the type of traffic is selected individually. In our case, the emphasis is on **organic search traffic**.

## <a name="mvp"></a> MVP, Product Vision and Backlog

We talked about the product idea and its vision, then began making the Minimum Viable Product (MVP). Since we're building a comparator, the MVP has two text fields to compare two JSONs, along with a button between the fields.

> ** If you're pleased with your MVP, you've released the product too late. ** - Reid Hoffman

After finalizing the idea, we discussed the appearance of the application in its ultimate version. We imagined a service that, as mentioned before, would concentrate on formatting, converting, and comparing text files of various formats, including plain text, JSON, XML, and YAML (YML).

Compiling the **backlog** was intriguing, as it involved shifting from a developer-centric mindset to a product-oriented one. Developers often create products with features they personally like and find useful, but a backlog is essential for setting immediate goals, prioritizing, and determining order.

During backlog compilation, we realized the importance of having the application online before implementing core functionality. Consequently, we prioritized launching the website, establishing basic backlinking, and then progressing to develop the functionality.

While studying SEO, we found the service **[ahrefs](https://ahrefs.com/)** to be very helpful, along with **["The Beginner’s Guide to SEO"](https://ahrefs.com/seo)**. These articles guided us on how to search for keywords, phrases, and how to create meta tags for the page, which we implemented in our SEO strategy.

During our SEO studies, we found the **[ahrefs](https://ahrefs.com/)** service and **["The Beginner’s Guide to SEO"](https://ahrefs.com/seo)** to be extremely helpful. These resources provided guidance on searching for keywords, phrases, and creating meta tags for the page, which we incorporated into our SEO strategy.

Clearly, to generate backlinks, we needed a destination to which links could be directed. Therefore, among our top-priority tasks, alongside studying SEO, were:

-   Creating a GitHub repository to establish the first backlink
-   Deploying the application
-   Setting up a placeholder website with basic metadata, including:
    -   Meta title
    -   Meta description
    -   H1, H2 headings

## How to make meta data (title, description) for beginners?

**Title** tags play a crucial role in deciding which result to click on, so it's essential to make them compelling. Here are some tips:

-   **Keep them short** – Aim for under 70 characters to avoid truncation.
-   **Match search intent** – Clearly communicate that you have what searchers want.
-   **Be descriptive** – Avoid vagueness or generic wording.
-   **Avoid clickbait** – Ensure the title aligns with your content.
-   **Include the keyword** – Use a close variation if it fits better.
-   **Add the year** – Especially for topics that require up-to-date information.

**Meta descriptions** may not directly impact Google rankings, but they can boost clicks and traffic as Google often uses them for the search results snippet. Follow these tips for effective meta descriptions:

-   **Keep them short** – Aim for under 160 characters to prevent truncation.
-   **Expand on the title tag** – Add unique selling points that couldn't fit in the title.
-   **Match search intent** – Emphasize what searchers are looking for.
-   **Use an active voice** – Speak directly to the searcher.
-   **Include your keyword** – Google often highlights this in the results.

After setting up our placeholder website, we're ready to create external links. Instead of buying backlinks, we prefer organic traffic. We'll focus on platforms like Quora and Stack Overflow, given our developer-oriented product. To organize our efforts, we use Notion to track where and when we'll share links. We avoid spamming and leaving links irresponsibly to maintain a positive online presence and avoid bans. Our first backlink was on Quora, where we answered a question about comparing JSONs, showcasing our service. However, we learned about the "rel=nofollow" attribute, which some sites use, rendering backlinks ineffective.

Also, you can read about the **'rel' attribute** at [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/att_a_rel.asp).

## Summary

The beginning of an SEO journey has been a fantastic learning experience. We kicked things off by improving an online comparison tool, exploring diverse traffic sources like direct, organic, paid, referred, social, and email marketing.

Building our MVP and envisioning the final product made us shift from a developer-centric to a product-oriented mindset.

We tackled the challenge of backlinks by strategically sharing on platforms like Quora and Stack Overflow, keeping things organized with Notion. However, we quickly learned about the quirks of the "rel=nofollow" attribute, impacting backlink effectiveness.

As we wrap up our first week with Diff.app, our focus on responsible link-sharing and a commitment to organic growth are unwavering. We're thrilled about the journey ahead, ready to adapt and refine our SEO strategy in the ever-evolving landscape. Stay tuned for more exciting updates!
