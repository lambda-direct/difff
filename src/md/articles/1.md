## We are programmers who want to learn how to do SEO in all its aspects.

We will share our decision & change log with you and start implementing it right away, beginning with how it all started.

### Idea

Embarking on the creation of a larger product, we realized the necessity of learning SEO on a smaller scale. The idea came to us quite quickly. One of our colleagues visited an online comparator's page and recognized that, in terms of quality, the tool was far from ideal. Consequently, we decided to practice SEO specifically on such a tool and, in the meantime, develop a superior version of such a service.

We will create an application that addresses issues related to text files, including validation, formatting, conversion, and comparison. We will work with all text file formats such as plain text, JSON, XML, YAML (YML), and others.

### Final product vision

Once we finalized the idea, we started discussing how the application would look in its final version. We envisioned a service that, as mentioned earlier, would focus on formatting, converting, and comparing text files of all formats, such as plain text, JSON, XML, YAML (YML).

### MVP**([Minimum viable product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_viable_product))**

After discussing the idea and the overall vision for the product, we started creating the Minimum Viable Product (MVP). In our case, since we decided to build a comparator, the MVP consists of two text fields that compare two JSONs with button between fields.

### Backlog

Compiling the backlog was a particularly interesting part, as it required a shift in thinking from a development perspective to a product-oriented approach. Typically, when developers create their product, it's often just a set of features they like and find useful for users. Therefore, the backlog is crucial in helping to establish the immediate goals for the product and determine the order and priorities.

While compiling the backlog, the first thing we noticed was that the application should be online before we implement the core functionality. Therefore, we decided to first launch the website, establish basic backlinking, and only then proceed to develop the functionality.

### Basic SEO & Back links

While studying SEO, we found the service https://ahrefs.com/ to be very helpful, along with "The Beginner’s Guide to SEO" (https://ahrefs.com/seo). These articles guided us on how to search for keywords, phrases, and how to create meta tags for the page, which we implemented in our SEO strategy.

It's evident that to create backlinks, we needed to establish a place to which links could be directed. Therefore, among the top-priority tasks, in addition to studying SEO, were:

-   Purchasing a domain
-   Creating a GitHub repository to formalize the first backlink
-   Deploying the application
-   Setting up a placeholder website with basic metadata
    -   Meta title
    -   Meta description
    -   H1, H2 headings

### First Back link

After creating the placeholder website, we can now proceed to create the first external links to our service. We learned that it's possible to pay certain services to place links to your site, but it's worth noting that bots can easily detect purchased backlinks. Moreover, buying traffic is not our goal; we aim to generate organic traffic from users who find our services genuinely helpful.

The simplest way to implement backlinking for your site is to visit platforms where people share links to their startups and leave your links there. However, given that the theme of our product is developer-oriented, we can leverage Q&A sites such as Quora and Stack Overflow for this purpose.

To keep track of where and when to place links, we created a database in Notion where we compiled a list of resources and assigned the first date when we plan to post a link to our site. Since we consider ourselves responsible internet users, we do not recommend simply leaving links as responses to questions. This not only pollutes sites that are friendly to us but may also lead to being banned, which is entirely justified. =)

The first site where we placed a backlink to our application was Quora. There, we found a question asking how to compare two JSONs. We provided the user with a comprehensive response, detailing how it can be done in pure JavaScript, using libraries, or showcasing our service as a no-code solution.

We were pleased with our first placed backlink until we remembered the existence of the "rel=nofollow" attribute

We found that well-known websites use the "rel=nofollow" attribute for links, which prevents search engines from following these links. Therefore, backlinking is only effective on websites that allow "dofollow" links.

Afterward, we went through all the listed websites and realized that 90% of them simply block bots from accessing our application. And that's how our first week of creating Difff.app went.
