## What is JSON file format?

**JSON (JavaScript Object Notation)** - lightweight format for storing and transporting data, "self-describing" and easy to understand. The format is syntactically identical to the JavaScript objects. JS program can easily convert JSON data into native JS objects.

### Syntax rules:

-   Name/value pairs structure
-   Pairs separated by commas
-   Objects are stored within curly braces
-   Square brackets hold arrays

## JSON

The keys have to be string, number, second JSON object, array, boolean, or null.
JSON can convert between text and object with methods, parse(), and stringify().
Parse method accepts a JSON string as a parameter and automatically returns a JavaScript object.

Stringify method accepts an object as a parameter and automatically returns a JSON string.

## Why do we use JSON?

Lightweight language data interchange format in comparison to other available options, it can be used for API integration. Advantages of JSON:

-   Less Verbose: In contrast to XML, JSON follows a compact style to improve its users readability.
-   Faster: Parsing process is faster than that of the XML. However, JSON requires less data that ultimately results in reducing the cost and increasing the parsing speed.
-   Readable: Easily readable. Regardless of the programming language that you are using, you can easily map the domain objects.
-   Structured Data: Used a map data structure. The key-value pairs limit the task but easily understandable.
