## Why minify JavaScript code?

Minimization, another term for minification, refers to the process of removing all unnecessary characters from JavaScript source code without changing its functionality.
Once minified, the code becomes nearly unreadable to the naked eye. Extraneous white spaces, comments, newline characters, and other elements that made the code readable are deleted,
resulting in a compact file size. Web servers and browsers can parse file content without well-structured code, it create additional network traffic
without providing any functional benefit. Minified JS can lead to file size reductions up to 60%.

## Pros and Cons of Minifying JavaScript Code?

JavaScript can have a negative effect on web page performance by slowing them down. One solution is to minify the JS code, which helps free up space and enhance website load performance.

Pros:

-   Pages load time is reduced, and your website consumes less bandwidth.
-   The execution time of scripts is reduced.
-   Decreased server load resulting from fewer HTTP queries.
-   Minimized versions are difficult to understand and steal for reuse.

Cons:

-   Minification might cause interference with other complex scripts due to site-specific elements such as themes, plugins, and the server environment.
-   Minification should be utilized alongside other methods for enhancing performance.
-   Minifying may not result in substantial performance improvements on its own.
-   Debugging minified files become more difficult.

## Differences Between JavaScript Minification, Uglification, and Compression

JS uglification involves rewriting the code to make it less understandable to humans. This process makes the code more difficult to read by removing whitespace, semicolons,
and comments, modifying function names, variable names, and other identifiers. While it enhances performance, it also lowers readability, making the code safer and less appealing to
potential stealers. Compression transforms the code into a binary format using algorithms like gZIP, resulting in smaller file sizes and quicker loading times.
Minification only reduces whitespace and comments. Minification and compression are reversible processes, allowing you to restore the code to its original state. However, uglification
is not reversible.
