## What is the point of JSON minification?

Applications use [JSON](/#jsonAnchor) for data exchange and serialization purposes. Size of the file matters, smaller files contribute to cost-effectiveness and faster performance. In web development, [JSON](/#jsonAnchor) is commonly used to fetch and display dynamic content on web pages. Files could be unnecessarily large, containing whitespace, comments, etc., which do not impact functionality. Minification is the process of removing unnecessary characters from the file without damning its functionality, it helps reduce the amount of
data that could be transferred between the server and the user's browser.

Advantages of JSON Minify:

-   Faster Loading Times: A reduced [JSON](/#jsonAnchor) file size facilitates quicker data transfer, which can be transmitted more swiftly, resulting in faster page loading times.

-   Bandwidth Savings: Beneficial for users with limited internet connections or those accessing websites via mobile devices.

-   Improved Page Responsiveness: Faster parsing and processing times on the client side improve page responsiveness, ensuring prompt display of dynamic content

## When should JSON be minified?

In web development, minified files deployed to production, witch reduce file size and improve loading times for web applications. For API integration, minified responses from APIs
can minimize data transfer and improve response times, particularly for mobile clients or low-bandwidth connections. Data storage, minified files requires less disk space,
saving storage costs for data stored in databases or on cloud servers. Additionally, improve page load speed for websites with large [JSON](/#jsonAnchor) datasets by reducing the time it takes to
download and parse it.

## Is minified JSON faster?

After minification, it leads to quicker data transfer and parsing compared to non-minified. Transferred data is minimized, parsing can be faster because there are fewer characters to
process. Based on the test results, minification reduces the weight by around 50-60%. One of the results, the [JSON](/#jsonAnchor) file initially weighs 65.4 KB and contains 66908 characters.
It decreases to 30298 characters and 29.2 KB in size.

## What is the difference between compress and minify?

Minification involves removing unnecessary parts such as whitespace and comments. Compression, on the other hand, applies algorithms to rewrite the file's binary code,
using fewer bits than the original. Both are low-effort, provides the same benefit of making files smaller. Compression typically requires a tool like gzip, which works by finding
repetitive strings and replacing them with pointers to the first instance of the string. This reduces the overall file size because pointers use less space than text.
